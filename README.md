# FTTL Wordpress Theme

This Worpress theme is built on top of a starter theme called `_s`, or `underscores`, developed by Automattic.
Here's [a link](http://underscores.me/) to their page where you can get started with making your own themes with _s.

This theme is designed to re-create an old desktop-only site I built in early 2015 as part of my studies. I wanted the site to be able to be anaged through Wordpress and to add a responsive element.

You can see the code for the original site [here](https://github.com/lena-pl/fly-to-the-limit), and the Behance project page with some screenshots [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/25793939/Fly-to-the-Limit-Website).

## Features and Usage Guide

For best results, a logo should be uploaded to the header (can be done when "customising" the theme), and a feature image should be set for each page, especially if you're using the pullout text feature.

This theme does not display page titles as headings. Please write your own heading inside the page template and set its size/style to "Heading 1", or use the h1 html element when using the text editor.

This theme is designed for websites, not blogs, so styling may be missing for some post features.

## Status

This theme is still incomplete. I am working on it and adding more features every day.
